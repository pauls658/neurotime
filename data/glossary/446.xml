<description><![CDATA[<p>The <b>middle meningeal artery</b>&nbsp;is the largest of the three paired meningeal arteries. &nbsp;It&nbsp;suppiies the dura as well as the calvarium. As with the other smaller meningeal arteries, it runs in the periosteal layer of the dura. &nbsp;It is typically the third branch of the first portion of the maxillary artery -- which itself is one of two terminal branches of the external carotid artery. &nbsp;It branches from the maxillary artery in the infratemporal fossa and travels through the foramen spinosum to enter the cranial cavity. &nbsp;As it runs along the greater wing of the sphenoid, it divides into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branch travels superior to the pterion and then curves posteriorly toward the vertex of the cranium. &nbsp;The posterior branch travels in a posterior-superior direction and distributes over the posterior aspect of the cranium. &nbsp;Of clinical significance is the fact that it is vulnerable to injury where it travels near the thin pterion portion of the skull. &nbsp;Rupture of the middle meningeal results in a life-threatening epidural hematoma.</p>
