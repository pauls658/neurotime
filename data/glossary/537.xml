<description><![CDATA[<p>The descending motor pathways (<b>corticospinal, corticobulbar, corticopontine tracts</b>) originate in the cerebral cortex and then travel through the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the cerebral crus of the midbrain, the basilar portion of the pons and the pyramids of the medulla.&nbsp; [The corticopontine fibers terminate in the basilar portion of the pons.]&nbsp; The upper motor neurons of the <b>corticospinal</b> and <b>corticobulbar tracts</b> are often referred to as the <b>pyramidal pathway</b>.&nbsp; These corticobulbar and corticospinal neurons terminate on lower motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord.&nbsp; The continuity of these descending motor pathways can be seen in those coronal sections of the brain that include these structures.</p>]]></description>
