<description><![CDATA[<p>The <b>cerebral cortex</b> is the thick convoluted layer of gray matter that covers the cerebral hemispheres. It is folded into gyri and sulci. &nbsp;The majority of the cortex, known as the neocortex, consists of six layers of neurons while the older paleocortex (olfactory areas) and archichortex (hippocampus) have fewer layers. The cerebral cortex is highly organized into functional areas:  motor, somatosensory, visual, auditory, olfactory, limbic, etc.</p>]]></description>
