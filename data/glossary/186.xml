<description><![CDATA[<p>The <b>interposed nucleus</b> is AKA the nucleus interpositus. It includes the emboliform plus globose nuclei located between the fastigial and the dentate nuclei deep within the core of white matter of the cerebellum.  In non-human species the globose and emboliform appear as a single nuclear mass and are termed the 'interposed' nucleus or 'nucleus interpositus'; this term is commonly used in human neuroanatomy as well.  It receives input from the paravermal zone of cerebellar cortex and projects its output via the superior cerebellar peduncle to terminate in the ventral lateral nucleus of thalamus and the red nucleus.</p>]]></description>
