<description><![CDATA[<p>The <b>radicular arteries </b>branch from the segmental arteries of the thorax and abdomen. These vessels travel to the spinal cord via the dorsal and ventral roots and anastomose around the spinal cord with arterial branches coming from the anterior and posterior spinal arteries to form the vasa corona. In the area of T12 usually on the left side, one of these radicular branches is particularly large and may supply the entire lumbosacral spinal cord; it is known as the great radicular artery or the <b>Artery of Adamkiewicz.</b></p>]]></description>
