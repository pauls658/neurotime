<description><![CDATA[<p>The cerebellum is precisely organized in terms of cellular types and layers.  In addition to that precise organization, there is evidence to indicate that different areas of the cerebellum have different functions in terms of motor control and corrdination.  These different areas of the <b>cerebellum</b> are termed <b>functional zones</b> and are arranged in a longitudinal direction from the medially-located vermis to the laterally-located hemispheres.  The three paired zones are:  vermal, paravermal (or intermediate) and lateral.</p>]]></description>
