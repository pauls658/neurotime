<description><![CDATA[The paired dorsal columns of the spinal cord are AKA the posterior columns.  They are located between the dorsal lateral sulci with the dorsal medial septum septum between them.  They include the gracile fasciculus in cord segments below the mid-thoracic level; above this level, the dorsal columns consist of the gracile fasciculus  plus the cuneate fasciculus.  The dorsal columns carry somatosensory (tactile, proprioceptive, vibratory) information from the body. The gracile fasciculus carries information from the lower extremities and body while the cuneate fasciculus carries information from the upper extremities and body.]]></description>
