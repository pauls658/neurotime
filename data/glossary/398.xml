<description><![CDATA[<p>The <b>nasal cavity</b> is divided into right and left halves by the nasal septum. &nbsp;It is entered anteriorly via the nares. &nbsp;It opens posteriorly into the nasopharynx through the choanae. &nbsp; The nasal conchae (superior, middle and inferior) are convoluted, scroll-like structures that curve inferomedially from the lateral wall of each half of the nasal cavity. &nbsp;The paranasal sinuses are air-filled extensions of the nasal cavity into the frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid and maxillary bones.</p>]]></description>
