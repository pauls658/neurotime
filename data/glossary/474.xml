<description><![CDATA[<p>The&nbsp;<b>insula</b>&nbsp;is an area of cerebral cortex (AKA insular cortex or Island of Reil) that is concealed by the opercula of the frontal, parietal and temporal gyri. It was originally the lateral surface of the telencephalon but was overgrown during development by the other cerebral lobes. It generally consists of three <b>short gyri </b>located anteriorly and two long gyri located posteriorly.</p>]]></description>
