<description><![CDATA[<p>The <b>lateral zone of the cerebellum</b> makes up the largest part of the cerebellum and projects to the dentate nucleus.&nbsp; It is thought to be involved in the planning and programming of learned, skilled movements movements, such as playing the piano or typing.&nbsp; Since it is part of a major neural circuit with the motor and premotor cerebral cortex [motor/premotor cortex to corticopontocerebellar tract to contralateral cerebellar cortex to dentate nucleus to contralateral ventral lateral and ventral anterior thalamus and back to motor/premotor cerebral cortex] it is thought that it may act by influencing the motor and premotor cortex.</p>
