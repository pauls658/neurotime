<description><![CDATA[<p>The <b>spinal trigeminal nucleus</b> is AKA the trigeminal spinal nucleus. It is a portion of the trigeminal sensory nuclei that exists as a longitudinal column of cells within the lateral aspect of the caudal pons and medulla.  Caudally, it merges with the dorsal horn of the spinal cord; rostrally it merges into the trigeminal main sensory nucleus.  It consists of second-order sensory neurons that receive primarily pain and temperature information from the head via input from the trigeminal spinal (or spinal trigeminal) tract.  Efferents from this nucleus terminate in the contralateral ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus.</p>]]></description>
