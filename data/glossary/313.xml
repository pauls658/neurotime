<description><![CDATA[<p>The <b>superior olivary nucleus</b> is located in the tegmentum of the caudal pons near the rostral end of the facial motor nucleus.  This nucleus is part of the auditory pathway and is NOT part of the inferior olivary complex of nuclei.  The superior olivary nucleus receives auditory input from both ears and gives origin to many of the lateral lemniscal fibers.  It is also the origin of efferent fibers to the contralateral organ of Corti where it is able to modulate hair cell activity.</p>]]></description>
