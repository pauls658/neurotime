<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Heschl's gyri </b>are AKA the transverse temporal gyri. They are a small number of short gyri located on the superior aspect of the superior temporal gyrus, inside the lateral sulcus.  Since this is the primary auditory cortex, its input comes from the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus via the sublenticular portion of the internal capsule.</p>]]></description>
