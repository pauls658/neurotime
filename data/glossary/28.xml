<description><![CDATA[<p><b>Basal ganglia</b> refers to a group of subcortical nuclei that includes the corpus striatum (caudate nucleus + putamen), globus pallidus, substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus.  They have strong interconnections with the cerebral cortex and are involved with diverse motor, cognitive and emotional functions. &nbsp;Note: &nbsp;This is one of the unusual examples when the term 'ganglia' is used for a central nervous system structure; more commonly, the term 'ganglion' or 'ganglia' refers to a collection of nerve cell bodies in the peripheral nervous system.</p>]]></description>
