<description><![CDATA[<p>The <b>neurohypophysis</b> is AKA the posterior lobe of the pituitary.  The infundibulum or pituitary stalk that attaches it to the medial eminence of the hypothalamus is part of the neurohypophysis. The supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus release oxytocin and vasopressin into the bloodstream in the neurohypophysis.  It is formed embryologically as a ventral outgrowth from the diencephalon.</p>]]></description>
