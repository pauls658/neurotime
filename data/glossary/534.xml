<description><![CDATA[<p>The <b>paravermal zone</b> of the <b>cerebellum</b> is also known as the intermediate zone since it is located between the vermal and lateral functional zones.&nbsp; The major inputs to the paravermal zone are from the motor cerebral cortex (corticopontocerebellar tract) and the spinal cord (dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar plus cuneocerebellar tracts), while the major output from this area is via the interposed nucleus (globose + emboliform) to the red nucleus and back to the motor cortex via connections in the ventral lateral and ventral anterior thalamic nuclei.&nbsp; Via these connections, the paravermal zone of the cerebellum influences lower motor neurons via the corticospinal tract and possibly the rubrospinal tract. The principal impact is on voluntary movements.</p>]]></description>
