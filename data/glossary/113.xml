<description><![CDATA[<p>A <b>dorsal root ganglion</b> is AKA a <b>sensory root ganglion</b> or <b>spinal ganglion</b>. It contains the cell bodies of pseudo-unipolar sensory neurons that innervate the skin, muscles, etc..  These neurons are often referred to as primary or first-order sensory neurons since they have a peripheral process that contacts the peripheral receptor and a central process that enters the spinal cord via the dorsal root.</p>]]></description>
