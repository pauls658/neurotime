Within the skull its 'outer' layer adheres tightly to the inside of the skull, constituting the periosteum.  An 'inner' meningeal layer separates out as reflections between parts of the cerebral hemisphere, i.e. cerebral falx or between the cerebral hemispheres and posterior fossa, i.e. tentorium cerebelli.  In the spinal dura mater there is a single layer separated from the vertebral periosteum by the epidural space.</p>]]></description></item>

It contains the cell bodies of pseudo-unipolar sensory neurons that innervate the skin, muscles, etc..  These neurons are often referred to as primary or first-order sensory neurons since they have a peripheral process that contacts the peripheral receptor and a central process that enters the spinal cord via the dorsal root.</p>]]></description></item>
